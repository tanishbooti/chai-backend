//this function is used to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) for the application.
//origin means that the application will accept requests from the specified origin (in this case, process.env.CORS_ORIGIN) and allow credentials (such as cookies or authorization headers) to be included in the requests.

app.use(express.json({limit: "16kb"})) //this enables JSON parsing for incoming requests with a maximum size of 16kb. It allows the application to parse JSON data in the request body and make it available in req.body.
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true, limit: "16kb"})) //it enables URL-encoded data parsing for incoming requests with a maximum size of 16kb. It allows the application to parse URL-encoded data (such as form submissions) in the request body and make it available in req.body.
app.use(express.static("public")) //it enables serving static files from the "public" directory. This means that any files located in the "public" directory can be accessed directly via HTTP requests.
app.use(cookieParser())  //cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on the client-side and sent to the server with each request. The cookie-parser middleware is used to parse cookies from incoming requests and make them available in req.cookies. This allows you to access and manipulate cookies in your application.

/*What are Middlewares?
Middlewares are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. They can perform various
tasks such as modifying the request or response objects, ending the request-response cycle, or calling the next middleware function in the stack. Middlewares are used for tasks like logging, authentication, error handling, and more.
